## How to install

- Make sure to have [.Net6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed

  the [latest release page](https://github.com/SWCreeperKing/Conbunnipelago/releases/latest).
    - Copy the `SW_CreeperKing.Conbunnipelago` folder from the release zip into `Mods` under your game's install directory.

## Important Footnotes

- everytime you join a new ap your settings get reset
  - this is only for the new save file made for AP, not your real one
- very easy to fall into a void (99% of the time the game will respawn you)
  - this is because if you don't have the transition you won't teleported
- There might be some strange behavior regarding disconnecting
  - any weierd behavior should be fixed by merely restarting the game
